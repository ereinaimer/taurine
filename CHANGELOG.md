# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Calculation Transformer (`| calc(...)`)**: Introduced inline arithmetic and numerical calculations directly within templates (e.g. `[amount=100 | calc("* 1.15")]` -> `115`, `[count=5 | calc("+ 1")]` -> `6`, and `[val=10 | calc("x * 2 + 5")]` -> `25`).

### Changed
- **Zero-Property Date and Time API**: Refactored `[date]` and `[time]` system variables to a highly extensible, method-based API (`.utc`, `.calc(...)`, `.format(...)`). You can now add and subtract durations (e.g., `[date.calc(+1d)]`) and use LDML tokens for fully custom formatting (e.g., `[time.format('Time:' hh:mm A)]`). All static properties (like `.iso`, `.long`, `.month`) have been removed.
- **Pruned Mock Data Generators (`mock.*`)**: Streamlined the `mock` namespace by removing hyper-niche and redundant variants (`bs`, `catch_phrase`, `status_code`, `method`, `user_agent`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `currency_name`, `currency_code`, `title`, `suffix`, and `password`). Standardized on core identity, geographic, web, and financial form-filling properties.

### Fixed
- **Pipeline Space Preservation**: Fixed aggressive space trimming bugs in global pipelines and hybrid arguments. Trailing spaces inside quotes are now correctly preserved when stripping quotes and executing case transformers.
- **Character Escaping Flow**: Fixed a bug where escaped directives like `\[key(enter)\]` would still execute due to eager unescaping during interpolation. Character unescaping is now deferred strictly to the final expansion parser. Added support for properly unescaping single (`\'`) and double (`\"`) quotes in normal text output.

## [1.0.0-alpha.6] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **AI Pipe Transformer (`| ai(...)`)**: Introduced support for resolving dynamic generative AI prompts and text transformations directly within templates via Unix pipe syntax (e.g. `[clipboard | ai(summarize this in 3 bullets)]`).

### Changed
- **Standardized Format Transformers to Unix Pipe Syntax (`|`)**: Replaced dot notation for format modifiers (`.upper`, `.truncate(...)`) with Unix pipe syntax (`| upper`, `| truncate(...)`, e.g. `[name=john | title]`). This completely resolves default value period ambiguity and enables clean, readable transformer chaining.
- **Renamed `run` System Variable Namespace to `execute`**: Updated inline shell execution variables from `[run.*]` to `[execute.*]`.
- **Standardized Directives to Function Syntax (`key` & `delay`)**: Standardized simulated key presses and pause delays to explicit function syntax (`[key(tab)]`, `[key(ctrl+a)]`, `[delay(200ms)]`) and removed legacy dot notation (`[delay.200ms]`, `[key.enter]`).
- **Standardized Environment Variable Syntax (`env`)**: Converted environment variable resolution from dot notation (`[env.VAR]`) to function-call syntax (`[env(VAR)]` and `[env("VAR")]`).

### Fixed
- **System Power Resilience**: Fixed an issue where Taurine stopped working entirely after Windows woke from sleep or session unlock due to OS low-level keyboard hooks (`WH_KEYBOARD_LL`) being silently invalidated. Taurine now properly force-rehooks and introduces a 1000ms delay to allow USB keyboards to re-enumerate smoothly.
- **Windows Startup Metadata**: Fixed an issue where Windows Task Manager's Startup tab displayed `taurine-startup.exe` instead of the application name by removing startup arguments from the registry key and reading them from an adjacent `.path` file instead.
- **Clipboard History**: Windows clipboard history is now entirely event-driven using `WM_CLIPBOARDUPDATE` messages rather than polling `OpenClipboard` every 150ms. This uses 0% CPU on idle, guarantees capture of all rapid clipboard updates, and completely eliminates race conditions and lock contention.

## [1.0.0-alpha.5] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Ignore Fullscreen Applications**: Added new background listener mechanism to detect when a fullscreen application (like a game) is in focus, automatically pausing macro evaluation to prevent accidental text injection.

### Fixed
- **Audio Feedback**: Fixed an issue where the pause and resume sounds were not playing due to a decoding incompatibility with the upgraded `rodio` audio library.

## [1.0.0-alpha.4] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Triggerless Mode**: Added a new configuration to expand trigger words automatically when typing without requiring the trigger character prefix (default: disabled).
- **Configurable Action Delimiter**: Added support for configuring the text expansion trigger to use either `Space` or `Enter` as the action delimiter. This can be customized via the TUI or CLI.
- **Clipboard Restore Delay Configuration**: Introduced a new `clipboard_restore_delay_ms` setting to configure the delay between pasting and restoring the clipboard. This can be customized via the TUI or CLI to mitigate clipboard race conditions on slower systems.

### Fixed
- **Windows 10 Clipboard Race**: Fixed an issue where rapid text expansions on Windows 10 sometimes pasted the previously copied clipboard content instead of the trigger payload due to Clipboard User Service (`cbdhsvc`) locking contention.

## [1.0.0-alpha.3] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed
- **Linux Keyboard Hotplug**: Restored function after disconnecting and reconnecting keyboards on linux by supervising `/dev/input` devices and restarting evdev listeners automatically.

## [1.0.0-alpha.2] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- **Audio Feedback**: Asynchronous audio feedback when toggling pause and resume states
- **Audio Configuration**: Support for configuring pause/resume audio feedback in CLI and TUI
- **Windows Metadata**: Embedded native Windows file version metadata into the CLI binary

### Fixed
- **Inline AI Lifecycle**: Resolved injection gating issues where text expansion/taurine stopped working after using inline AI
- **Audio Output Switching**: Resolved audio playback not switching to speakers after headphones are unplugged
- **CI/CD Linux Support**: Added `libasound2-dev` and other build dependencies to CI and Linux distribution packages to support audio output

## [1.0.0-alpha.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Text Expansion**: Turn short triggers into full text instantly in any application
- **Keyboard Shortcuts & Hotkeys**: Run text expansions and scripts with global hotkeys
- **Scripts**: Support for running scripts (PowerShell, Bash, JavaScript, Python)
- **Dynamic Variables**: Support for placeholders with arguments, defaults, and transformers (e.g., URL encode, title case)
- **System Variables**: Inject system data like date, time, clipboard content, and random data (UUIDs, mock data)
- **Inline Math**: Calculate mathematical expressions directly in any text field (`>5+3`)
- **Inline AI**: Stream AI responses directly into the active text field using backticks
- **CLI & TUI**: Manage automations visually via a Terminal UI or directly from the command line
- **Import & Export**: Backup and share automations using the `.tau` file format
